## Abstract

Writing has always been an artistic expression of an author, trying to put their feelings and thoughts into a story. With the purpose of entertaining the reader, the writer tries to create an atmosphere where the reader can get involved and absorbed by the story. However, what if we could predict how entertaining or well received a story would be, just by the words the writer used, or maybe the style of writing. Is there a more popular topic than others? In this study, we will test different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Recurrent Neural Networks and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, to try to detect which are the characteristics of a popular story.
